		<td><br><b>Clean</b> - The site is very minimalist and easy on the eyes.
			<br><b>Concise</b> - The about me is not too wordy and says just enough to give the viewer an idea of who this person is.
			<br><b>Technical</b> - The use of parallax makes the viewer assume that this person is qualified in his work.
		<td>The design is set up very chronologically so that the viewer sees everything they need to know -- who is this person, what does he do, how do we contact him. There isn't a lot of clutter so that everything that matters is easily accessible. 
		<td>All images that would navigate to another website would dim as the cursor hovered over it. The parallax on the page also separated every part about the author so that it was not unclear what we were looking at.
		<td>Every clickable page opened to a new tab, which I thought was really good for navigation. That means you never navigate off the main page and will always know where it is.

		<td><br><b>Sleek</b> - The image of the Macbook on the front page adds a subconcious association with Apple, and that these people are using top notch technology to make the best design for the customer.
			<br><b>Confusing</b> - The name of this company is "PixelWorkshop", however everything from the photos to the logo all seem very blurry. This is a contrast from the image they would like to portray-- which is that of sleek and high-definition images (what with the pixels in the name).
			<br><b>Dull</b> - The grayscale design does not work for this website soley because their logo is colorful, and also because it is called "PixelWorkshop". This makes me think of vibrant colors, but as I scroll down I am disappointed with all of the gray. 
		<td>The design of this website takes the viewer to where they need to be, and emphasizes the work that the company does, as would likely be the reason viewers would be looking at this site. However, not all of the design works well-- the down arrow at the beginning and the random word cloud are useless to the viewer, and the google maps page does not even list an address.
		<td>Not all the links in the Portfolios are clickable, but those that are do change colors on hover to indicate that it opens to a new page. The down arrow does have an interaction when we hover over it, but clicking it does not do an auto-scroll down or do anything at all. 
		<td>It is not obvious that you can scroll down initially because the down arrow doesn't show until you start scrolling. The logo is not clickable to reroute to the homepage. However, the top nav-bar is well placed and takes the viewer to wherever they would like to be. It is clear what the viewer is viewing at all times on the page. When the viewer clicks on a link however, it is harder to navigate back to the original company page because the link does not open in a new tab or window.

		<td><br><b>Natural</b> - the background colors remind me of Fall, and incorporate an idea of being out in the woods. 
			<br><b>Hip</b>	- The contrast of the hand-drawn background with the bottle of tea creates a hipster-like vibe, meaning that it is unique and unlike what anyone else is doing. 
			<br><b></b>
		<td>The layout is split up into 5 boxes-- one as the main idea of the website, and the rest as small components. I think this works well for the website, as it lays everything out that you would like to know all in one spot without needing to look around. However, it is not clear what each of these boxes are, and the cursive is a little hard to immediate read.
		<td>The main box shows a bottle of True Tea being plucked out of a landscape, which is both interactive and also helps the company give off the image that what they are selling is all natural. However, there is no indication that the other boxes are clickable besides the cursor change. 
		<td>You always know where you are because the box that you click will change color to indicate that it is the tab that you are on.

			<br><b></b>
		<td>I think the design doesn't work out as well as he wants it to because even though it is minimalist and clearly a portfolio of his work, it is not obvious because you don't know that the tabs on the top middle are indicators until you click around them. It also becomes clear when you click on any of the works, but at a glance, it isn't obvious.
		<td>Everything on the nav bar change color on hover, and hovering over any of the boxes of his work bring up a small description. The small description is very useful for the viewer, so that they don't have to click on everything if they are looking for something specific.
		<td>The navigation on top makes it easy to tell where you are. Even when viewing one of his works you can easily navigate back to the home page by clicking on his logo on the top left or clicking on portfolio on the nav bar.

		<td><br><b>Fun</b> - the way that everything moves when you hover over it creates a fun environment. 
			<br><b>Artsy</b> - the logo has some splash effect, and the background has some spray graffiti effects. These small changes, along with the bouncing interaction make the site feel like it is about art and design.
			<br><b>Professional</b> - Everything that you first see is the works of this company. It is obvious that they are advertising themselves and the work that they do.
		<td>At first glance, the viewer thinks that this website is one for designers. The carousel shows a lot of the work and viewers can decide from those whether or not they want to see more.
		<td>All the navigation links bounce when you hover over them except the social media images. However, those do change color when hovered over. The bounce doesn't work for this design though because the rest of the page feels so rigid, that the bounce-hover feels misplaced.
		<td>The sidebar allows me to effectively get to wherever I want to be at any page, but it feels like the page got cut off since there is so much whitespace to the left of the sidebar.

		<td><br><b>Creative</b> - This portfolio is unlike traditional portfolios in that it is a mock-Google. It is creative even though it is a copy because it strays from the traditional portfolio setup and has a unique browsing experience.
			<br><b>Technical</b> - Google seems simplistic, but they also have an image of doing very cutting edge, new tech. Simulating Google gives off the impression that this is a person that knows how to build something just like them.
			<br><b>Messy</b> - People generally know how to use a search engine, but this set up feels very messy because there is too much question about what is an actual search result versus what is his work. It also just feels like a huge blob of information.
		<td>The design doesn't work because it has too much going on. Although the viewer can figure out where to go for what they are looking for, it is a confusing experience. Also, when you are on the tabs "images" or "links" it is unclear what any of the images or links are supposed to mean.
		<td>The interactivty is exactly as you would expect when using Google as a search engine. The links highlight on hover and the nav-bar tab changes color to indicate the tab that you are on. The links that you have clicked change color to be purple. There isn't much interactivity in general, but it's sufficient to the purpose of this design.
		<td>The colored tabs always keep you aware of what you are looking at, and though clicking on a link will take you to the page within your tab, when you go back, you can see what you have cliked before. This works for a search engine because you wouldn't necessarily need a new tab, but for a portfolio, it would be better to open a new tab for links.

		<td><br><b>Multi-Dimensioned</b> - The opening screen of him and his two "shadows" gives him a multi-dimensional feel right from the get-go. You automatically think there is more to him than what meets the eye.
			<br><b>Cute</b> - The rounded corners of the font immediately makes me think "cute", and though I've seen all these icons before, on this website, I think of all the icons as very cute as well. 
			<br><b></b>
		<td>The design doesn't quite work because it is not immediately obvious how to navigate anywhere except to see the profile or his social networking sites. It is clear what I am looking at on all pages because there are titles, but it is not easy to get there. I am able to get all the information that I need, but the experience could be better. 
		<td>The opening screen is a nice way to start off the experience on the site, and every tab or link highlights on hover. It highlights to a different color, which is nice since it becomes obvious that it is clickable.
		<td>The navigation is not immediately obvious as the little bar on the top right. I would have expected the nav bar on the bottom to be placed right on top or as a side bar, so it was annoying to have to scroll all the way down to see it. However, it was easy to figure out where I was at all times because everything was titled.

		<td><br><b>Technical</b> - Much of the site definitely required lots of technical knowledge to build, and it is shown off very well with the moving backgrounds and disappearing images.
			<br><b>Confusing</b> - The design feels all over the place, and it confuses me to look at the site because I don't know what or where anything is. 
			<br><b>Detailed</b> - There seems to be a lot of detail on every portion of the site, from the shadowing to the moving image and to the disappearing bars/blobs.
		<td>The design seems very beautiful at first glance, but it is very hard to get around and know what everything is. When I click into any of the links that I presume are the portfolio, it is not obvious how I can return home or view a specific link. In addition, when I clicked on "and WORDS", which I wasn't sure about to begin with, the results still left me confused about what this section was for.
		<td>The site is very interactive, with moving pictures, tabs that shrink when you scroll past them, and blobs that disappear when you scroll past them. There is also a nice highlight when you hover over links that fits the color scheme well. However, I think all the interactive components other than the hover clutter the screen and are unneccessary.
		<td> There is no navigation bar anywhere, and navigating the site is not a good experience since it is so hard to figure out what everything means, and what to click to get to where I'd like to be.

		<td><br><b>Professional</b> - On every tab is something relevant about him and his work. He keeps this site about him and his work. 
			<br><b>Colorful</b> - Though the first page seems like it's just one color, it soon scrolls to the next tab and the next, which are all different colors.
			<br><b>Fun</b> - The changing colors and the moving characters in all the titles add a fun mix to what would otherwise be a very professional website.
		<td>The design works well for him- I always know where I am because the tab in which I'm at is always underlined on the nav bar and he keeps you in the loop (in the image with the hand, it is showing how many slides are left with fingers). I am also able to access all the information that I need easily, while he is still able to keep his design components. All that he tries to communicate is effectively laid out for me. The only thing lacking would be a lack of titling on each page.
		<td>This design is very interactive- every tab has something different. The moving components are also never annoying because he also places what you are looking for right there as well in case you don't want to scroll through the interaction. 
		<td>It is incredibly easy to navigate around and find my way through anything on this website. The back-arrows are always easy to find and in an obvious location, and the nav bar on top is always underlined at the tab you are at, and takes you to wherever you'd like to be.

		<td><br><b>Technical</b> - For this website, it is technical in a way tha that is not coding related. It is technical for all purposes that it needs to be- technical about tattoos. The art on the front page fits very well for what the site is about. It shows off skill with art/tattooing.
			<br><b>Artistic</b> - 
			<br><b>Minimalist</b> - There is nothing on the front page that is extraneous. Everything listed is just as much as needed to be said- nothing more, nothing less. 
		<td>The design for this website is very effective- I am not told anything more than what I want to know, and it does not try to tell me more. Instead of writing a bunch of words, he lets his work speak for him. 
		<td>The only interactivity on this site would be the transition when you click on any of the tabs. I like the fade in fade out transition because you know that you are leaving and entering a page. However, the lack of highlighting on hover makes me have to double guess at whether or not I can click on something.
		<td>The navigation on the front page is initially confusing because it's not obvious that you can click on tattoos and paintings, though if you did click on blog, it would bring you to a screen with the sidebar.
